* socket() creates a new socket
* bind() binds socket to an address, server uses this call
* listen() allows stream socket to accept incoming connections
* connect() establishes connection with another socket

# socket() # 
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
int domain: AF_UNIX, AF_INET, or AF_INET6
int type: communication type, SOCK_STREAM (TCP), SOCK_DGRAM (UDP)
int protocol: 0, for now

- Returns file descriptor to refer to newly created socket.
- Negative value on failure

# bind() #
binds socket to an address

int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen)
int sockfd: file descriptor from previous socket() call
const struct sockaddr* addr: pointer to structure specifying address to which socket to bind to.
addrlen: size of address structure;

struct sockaddr { 
    (unsigned short) sa_family_t sa_family; //address family (Af_* constant)
    char as_data[14];      // Socket address
}

Serves as generic container for various socket addresses.

* Used for IPv4 addresses 
sockaddr_in {
    short sin_family; // Address family 
    unsigned short port; // Port number, should convert to network byte order using htons(); 
    struct in_addr sin_addr; // Internet address, Represents IP address, set using inet_pton(); 
}

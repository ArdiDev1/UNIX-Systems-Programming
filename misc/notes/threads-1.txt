#Definitions:
-Process
    !Instance of a program currently running on computer
    !A virtual address space (memory)
    !Collection of files / sockets (io)
    !Collection of concurrent threads (execution units)

-Thread: 
    !Smallest unit of execution managed.
    by a scheduler.
    !Light weight entity.
    !Confined to a sigle process.

-Thread Creation:
    !Created by another thread.
    !Given stack to execute and function to run.
    !When process is created, there is one single thread.
    !Given a stack to execute and function to run.

-Thread death:
    !After completing task.
    !Requested by another thread.
    !When process dies.
    !Any thread calls exit()

-Thread return:
    !do NOT return stack variable from thread function.

-Thread concurrecy (Single core)
    !When one thread waiting for IO to complete.
    !Another thead can use CPU.
    !At any one point, CPU is only used for ONE thead.

-Thread concurrecy (Multicore)
    !Threads can execute in parallel, one on each core.
    !Timesharing is still used.

-Joining a thread: pthread_join()
    !waits for thread to compete.
    !blocks the calling thread until thread tid terminates.
    !Equivalent of waitpid() for processes.

#Thread Model
    Shared             Private (to each)
    Addr space.         Program counter.
    Global variable.    Registers.
    Open files.         Stack.
    Child processes.    State

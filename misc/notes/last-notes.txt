-==- Internet Protocol Stack -==- 

Application: supporting network applications.
(FTP, SMTP, HTTP)

Transport: process-process data transfer (TCP UDP).
Network: routing of datagrams.
Transport: process-process data transfer.
Link: data transfer between neighboring network elements (Ethernet, PPP)
Physical: bits (on the wire) 

Domain name:

Identification string, formed by rules are procedure in (DNS)

TCP/IP 
 -Name/IP and port number

-Socket: we get a file descriptor and can send and receive. send() recv()

Server side (TCP):

bind() Server binds (reserves) port for communication
listen() Server listens on port for "talk" requests
accept() When request comes.. 
    -Server allocates seperate socket to accept private communication.
    -(same host, different host)
send() / recv()
close() Conversation ends via a close.

Client side (TCP):

connect() Client init a session.
 -Need server name, type, and port.
communication goes on with send() / recv().
close() client closes a session.
( No bind is needed on client side )

struct sockaddr.
    -Holds address information for many types of sockets.
    -Need addrlen field to indicate size.

Sockets programming: Network protocols.
    -Need protocols at every level
    -TCP and ICP are protocols.

Two process talk at application level after tcp connect established.
    -Who should talk first.
    -How much should each talk.
    -How are messages encoded in bytes.

Common options: XML | JSON 
Endianess:
    -Big endian: store most significant byte first. first byte at lowest mem addr is largest.
    -Little endian: store least significant byte first, first byte (lowest mem addr) is smallest.

Both parties need to be in agreement to interpret bytes.

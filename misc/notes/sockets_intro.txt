- Client-Server scenerio, Each application creates a socket, apparatus that allows communication.
- Server binds its socket to well known address, Name.

# socket() syscall
fd = socket(domain, type, protocol)

Communication domains:

Sockets exist in a communication domain, detirmines 

-Method of identifying socket.
-Range of communication.

- Domain: AF_UNIX: allows communication between application on same host
  *addr format: pathname
  *structure sockaddr_un

- Domain: IPv4 (AF_INET) domain allows communication between applications running on host connected via (IPv4)
  *addr format: 32-bit IPv4 address + 16 bit port number
  *structure sockaddr_in

- Domain: IPv6, (AF_INET6) not as commonly used as IPv4, even though designed as sucessor.
  *addr 128 bit IPv6 address + 16 bit port number
  *structure sockaddr_in6

Socket types:
 * Every socket implementation provides two types: stream and datagram 
 * SOCK_STREAM, provides reliable, bidirectional, bytestream communication channels

SOCK_STREAM:
 * Reliable: guaranteed that transferred data is intact
 * Bidirectional: data may be transmitted in either direction

SOCK_DGRAM:
 * Data transmittion: Not reliable.
 * Message bounds are preserved.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Uses SOCK_DGRAM
TCP (Transmittion Control Protocol): Uses SOCK_STREAM
